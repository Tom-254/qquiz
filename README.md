## Learning Objectives

- Learning how to accurately define and plan the scope of a project to ensure that it meets the MVP needs and expectations.
- Learning how to design and implement a RESTful API that allows for easy and efficient communication between different parts of a system or between different systems.
- Learning how to use the React JavaScript library to build user interfaces and manage the state of an application.
- Learning how to deploy a website to a server and make it accessible to users on the internet.

## Technologies Used

- React: JavaScript library for building interfaces.
- Redux Toolkit: JavaScript library for managing application state.
- Flask: Python micro web framework.
- MongoDB: Cross-platform document-oriented database program.
- SQLAlchemy: Python SQL toolkit and object-relational mapper.

## Third Party Services Used

- Imgur Image API: Provides a rich set of APIs that allows developers to programmatically interact with the platform's features, including image uploading, album creation, and user authentication. This would be used for image storage in the application.
- Mailtrap API: Email API/SMTP that does the job reaching recipientsâ€™ inboxes just in time. It ensures high deliverability by default. This would be used to send emails in the application.
